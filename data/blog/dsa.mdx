## Introduction

When you think about code, what first comes to your mind is the ability of it copy itself run the same time at multiple places. Once you write a piece of code and unleash it to the world, I can bring you infinite leverage or infinite productivity. Once it is on the internet, anyone can copy it, run it, deploy it and distribute it. You rest while your code does the work, which is almost like money invested in assets, which will keep bring in productivity.

- What does a good piece of code mean? What measures a good algorithm? Btw Algorithm is a procedure written in code.
- The answer to this question brings us to BigO notation which is used to measure time complexity or efficiency of a particular algorithm.
- To make it more digestible let’s consider a loop, time complexity is O(n). For nested loops have time complexity of 0(n^2), O(n^3)..etc.
- Three things to remember when it comes to analysing time complexity, 1) Growth is in respect to input 2) Constants are dropped 3) Worst case is considerd.

## Search

### Linear search

- Array data structure is considered for input. Direct iterating over each elements and comparing with value. Time complexity O(n)

### Binary Search

- As the name suggests, input is logically divided into two parts and value is compared to find which half it belongs.
- This process is repeated until value is found. Complexity O(log n)
