    summary:
      'As a volunteer at STEPS, I had the opportunity to provide math tutoring to orphaned children in 10th grade, who were preparing for their final exams. I created lesson plans and teaching materials that suited the different needs and learning styles of each student. I also used various teaching methods, such as hands-on activities and visual aids, to help them understand the subject matter better. I regularly assessed their progress and gave them feedback and support to improve their academic performance. I also fostered a positive and inclusive learning environment, where students could participate and engage actively. Throughout this experience, I demonstrated excellent communication and interpersonal skills, and built strong relationships with students, fellow volunteers, and STEPS staff members.',
