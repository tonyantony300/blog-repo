### MacBook M1 Air

M1 is Apple's first chip designed specifically for Mac. Comes with ARM architecture, Apple silicon integrates the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O and so much more onto a single tiny chip. Packed with an astonishing 16 billion transistors, M1 delivers exceptional performance, custom technologies and unbelievable power efficiency. Most of the apps I've used on the MacBook Air are still the Intel versions, which macOS Big Sur uses Rosetta 2 to translate for working on its ARM-based processor.

- Made using TSMC's 5nm process (N5)
- 16 billion transistors
- 4 high-performance "Firestorm" cores
- 4 energy-efficient "Icestorm" cores
- 3.2GHz CPU clock speed
- CPU cores first seen in the iPhone 12 lineup's A14 Bionic chip
- Support for 8GB or 16GB unified memory
- 68.25GB/s memory bandwidth
- Neural Engine
- Media engine for hardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC
- Video decode engine
- Video encode engine
- Image signal processor (ISP)

### Personal note :

Buying this device was one of the piovtal decisions in my life. I made the decision to get into Software Engineering on the second year of my first job out of college. It is not easy to change career path. I consolidated my decision by saving up for three months and bought this device on 29th of November 2020 - 12 days after it was launched.

I calculated how old this device is for this blog and I am surprised to note that its been more than two and half years. It still feels like new. One of my Best decisions ever!

Its a breeze doing browsing and development in this device. No loading time, just like pressing a button to wake your mobile device from sleep. I use, I close the lid, whenever I feel like doing some research or work, I open it up, Its ready to work again, **zero** delay.

It is so lightweight that I always carry it on my backpack.

One of the two valuable things I own, other one is my phone.

Sometime I feel like all I need are internet pack and these two devices, I will be able to afford a roof over my head.

No words. It feels like a part of me.
